# RiskBadge 🔍

RiskBadge helps you understand the **security impact of your installed Chrome extensions**.

It analyzes:
- permissions
- host access
- changes over time (updates, new permissions, new extensions)

⚠️ RiskBadge does **not** label extensions as malicious.
It shows **technical access and potential impact if compromised**.

## Features
- One-click extension risk scan
- Silent daily monitoring
- Alerts for:
  - new extensions
  - permission changes
  - host access expansion
- Badge showing unseen alerts
- 100% local analysis (no servers)

## Privacy
RiskBadge runs entirely on your device.
No data is collected, stored remotely, or shared.

## Why RiskBadge?
Many users install extensions and forget about them.
RiskBadge brings visibility back — calmly and transparently.
